> I am excited about the places where science and software meet.

I am currently working in medical analytics software. Real time modeling of human physiology for patients who are the most at risk in hospitals.

My first gigs were in the modeling of chemistry in the atmosphere for the purposes of air pollution and climate change. Forest fires, cars, 3D modeling of airplane emissions. Real time systems, massively parallel retrospecitve simulations. You name it. It was great fun.

I have degrees in physics, math, and engineering. I'm into rock climbing, trailing running, backpacking, and lately chess.
