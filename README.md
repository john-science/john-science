### theJollySin is an anagram of John Stilley

> I am excited about the places where science and software meet.

My first gigs were in the modeling of chemistry in the atmosphere for the purposes of air pollution and climate change. Forest fires, cars, 3D modeling of airplane trajectories. Real time systems, massively parallel retrospecitve simulations. You name it. Great fun.

I am currently working in medical analytics software. Real time modeling of human physiology for patients who are the most at risk in hospitals.

I have degrees in physics, math, and engineering. I'm into rock climbing, trailing running, backpacking, and lately bread baking.
