> I am excited about the places where science and software meet.

I am currently working in nuclear reactor design and analysis software.

My first gigs were in the modeling of chemistry in the atmosphere for the purposes of air pollution and climate change. Forest fires, cars, 3D modeling of airplane emissions. Real time systems, massively parallel retrospecitve simulations. You name it. It was great fun. I have also worked in real time medical analytics software.

I have degrees in physics, math, and engineering. I'm into rock climbing, backpacking, trailing running, and lately chess.
