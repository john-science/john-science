### I am excited about the places where science and software meet.

My first gigs were modeling atmospheric chemistry for the purposes of air pollution and climate change. I have also worked in real time medical analytics software.

I am currently working in nuclear reactor design and analysis software.

I have degrees in physics, math, and engineering. I'm into rock climbing, backpacking, trailing running, bread baking, and spicy food.
